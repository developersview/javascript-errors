# javascript-errors

> Error objects are thrown when runtime errors occur. The Error object can also be used as a base object for user-defined exceptions. See below for standard built-in error types.

## Description
 > Runtime errors result in new Error objects being created and thrown.

 > Error is a serializable object, so it can be cloned with structuredClone() or copied between Workers using postMessage().
